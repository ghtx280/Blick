## Structure of classes and attributes

### Key

```javascript
flex: 'display:flex';
```

The key of the object defines its name, if we write `class="flex"` we will get `display: flex`.

But this is too simple, we need to set values, for this we have to write the class as an object

### Prop & Unit

```javascript
m: {
    _prop: "margin:$",
    _unit: "px"
}
```

We can use different parameters in the object, one of them is `_prop`   
\*parameters that start with `_` are service parameters

`_prop` is responsible for dynamic values, it can contain `$` which will be replaced by your value

```
m-25     => margin: 25px
m-auto   => margin: auto
m-20+30  => margin: 20px 30px
m-1em+30 => margin: 1em 30px
```

`_unit` is added to a separate value if it is a number

### multi values

```javascript
mx: {
    _prop: `
        margin-left:$1;
        margin-right:$2
    `,
    _unit: "px"
}
```

Together with `$` you can use a number that indicates the order of the values written with `+`

```
mx-10    => margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px
mx-10+20 => margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 20px
```

`_unit` can be an array, then each element will correspond to a number near `$`

```javascript
_unit: ['px', 'em'];
```

```
mx-10    => margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px
mx-10+20 => margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 20em
```

But again, if the value contains anything other than numbers, then `_unit` will not be added

```
mx-1em    => margin-left: 1em;  margin-right: 1em
mx-10+20% => margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 20%
```

### Vals

```javascript
w: {
    _prop: "width:$",
    _unit: "px",
    _vals: {
        full: "100%"
    }
}
```

`_vals` are some ready-made values that replace `$`, they have a higher priority over dynamic values, which means that the script will first look for values in `_vals`

```
w-full => width: 100%
w-500  => width: 500px
```

### One

```javascript
flex: {
    _prop: "gap:$",
    _unit: "px",
    _one: "display:flex"
}
```

`_one` will be used if there is no value, that is, you just write the name of the key

```
flex-15 => gap: 15px
flex    => display: flex
```

### Selector

```javascript
space: {
    _prop: "margin-left:$",
    _unit: "px",
    _selector: "$ > * + *"
}
```

Rarely, but if you need to define a selector, there is a `_selector` parameter, here also `$` will be replaced by a selector

```
space-10 => .space-10>*+* { margin: 10px }
```

### Nested classes

```javascript
flex: {
    _prop: "gap:$",
    _unit: "px",
    _one: "display:flex",
    col: "flex-direction:column",
    row: "flex-direction:row",
    foo: {
        _prop: "test:$",
        baz: "something: 123"
    }
}
```

In addition to special parameters, you can write absolutely any other parameters next to it, it will be a nested class, they have the same structure as described above, and to get to the next one you just need to write it as a chain separated by `-`

```
flex         => display: flex
flex-20      => gap: 20px
flex-5em     => gap: 5em
flex-col     => flex-direction: column
flex-foo-15  => test: 15
flex-foo-baz => something: 123
```

## Attributes

The structure of the attributes is the same as listed above, but there is also `_else`, this is a function that is executed when the script goes through all the options and finds nothing



```css
flex="20"
```

Here `20` is a dynamic value generated by the `_else` function

The attribute structure has one more additional parameter `_using`, it adds styles if the attribute is used
For example, the flex attribute has the following parameter
```javascript
_using: "[flex]{display:flex}"
```

You can add your own attributes inside a config

```javascript
config({
    attr: {
        color: {
            _using:"[color]{font-size:20px}",
            _else: function({ style }){
                return "color:" + style
            },
            foo: {
                _prop: "test:$"
            },
            baz: "something: 123"
        }
    }
})
```
then use it like
```
color="red foo-123 baz"
------------------------
red     => color: red
foo-123 => test: 123
baz     => something: 123
```
